<p><strong>What is it:</strong>  A final project for CS 445 - Object Oriented Design Programming.</p>

<p><strong>College:</strong> Illinois Institute of Technology</p>

<h1>Project Memo</h1>

<h2>Project Status</h2>

<p>The full requirements for functionality of the software have been implemented. This web app was built for the owner of the business only. </p>

<h3>Tours</h3>

<ul>
<li>the ability to create (valid) tours</li>
<li>define their parameters</li>
<li>cancel them (with refund to customers)</li>
<li>search by dates</li>
<li>see details</li>
<li>edit the tours.</li>
<li>automatically refund difference on fully paid bookings to customers on price decrease</li>
</ul><h3>Bookings</h3>

<ul>
<li>create a (valid) booking for customer for a specific tour</li>
<li>pay for booking or leave it unpaid (once paid setting to unpaid will not refund the money -for that you need to cancel the booking [to activate the logic])</li>
<li>Cancel a booking</li>
<li>Edit a booking</li>
<li> see the price you need to pay per seats selected (only in the modal popup form where the tour selected is known before the form loads)</li>
</ul><h3>Customers</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create a (valid) customer (must have unique email)</li>
<li>Delete customer</li>
<li>See all customer transactions/bookings and spendings/refunds</li>
<li>see total spent by customer</li>
<li>edit customer details</li>
</ul><h3>Reports</h3>

<ul>
<li>see all ‘Accounting Transactions’ money in/out</li>
<li>everything is automated</li>
<li>allow deleting of record but with warning that it might mess up the data (feature relatively hidden)</li>
<li>view total earnings for business</li>
<li>see reason for transactions</li>
<li>auto color coded for easy differentiation</li>
</ul><h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>The project was built using <em>Ruby v1.9.3</em>, <em>Rails 3.2</em>, <em>CoffeeScript</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Sass</em>, and <em>CSS</em>.
The database used is <em>SQLite 3</em> for development and test and <em>PostgreSQL</em> for production.
For UI Twitter Bootstrap was used.</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<h3>Web Interface</h3>

<p>The project can be accessed via the web interface at
<a href="http://lfss.herokuapp.com">http://lfss.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<h3>Source Code</h3>

<p>The repository can be cloned at <a href="https://github.com/dkarter/The-Lion-Fish-Scuba-Store">https://github.com/dkarter/The-Lion-Fish-Scuba-Store</a> or by using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; git clone git@github.com:dkarter/The-Lion-Fish-Scuba-Store.git
</code></pre>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>The project can be built by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>The database can then be populated by using the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; rake db:migrate 
</code></pre>

<p>The app can then be run by using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; rails s 
</code></pre>

<p>And visiting localhost:3000/ on your browser.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Basic tests for user interaction were developed using Cucumber and Capybara, but <strong>not completed</strong> due to time constraints.
Test case files can be found in the ‘features’ directory of the code. Test can be run via the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; cucumber features/
</code></pre>

<h2>Additional Details</h2>

<h3>Hours to completion:</h3>

<p>I estimate around 110 hours including design, setup, and learning required.</p>

<h3>Difficulties:</h3>

<p>My biggest difficulty was writing the tests in <em>Cucumber</em> and <em>Capybara</em> since I have never used these technologies before. I was running out of time and decided to skip most of them and just jump right into functionality. </p>

<p>The functionality took a very long time to develop and perfect and I was trying to learn <em>Sass</em> and <em>CoffeeScript</em> along the way to make the interface perfect while picking up new skills.</p>

<p>It was a very stressful but an enjoyable learning experience.</p>
